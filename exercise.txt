Rebase and Squash

1. Create another branch, e.g. test_branch (to perform rebase/squashing on later)
2. Push 1 or 2 commits on branch 'main' (so that test_branch is behind origin/main)
3. Push a few commits on test_branch
4. Squash and Rebase test_branch to be up-to-date with origin/main

Hint:
- To squash multiple commits into 1 commit, you can use git rebase: 
git rebase -i HEAD~<the-number-of-commits-to-squash-counting-from-HEAD> (example: git rebase -i HEAD~3)

- Rebase to be up-to-date with 'main': git rebase -i main
